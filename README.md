## Prometheus Monitoring

### Connecting to Grafana

You can use port-forwarding to connect to Grafana:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-grafana 3001:80 -n prometheus
```

Then open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

> Note: You do not need to use port 3001, you can use any port you want. However, you will need to target port 80 in the port-forward command. For example, if you want to use port 3002, you would run `kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-grafana 3002:80 -n prometheus`.

To login to Grafana, use the username `admin` and the password `prom-operator`.
